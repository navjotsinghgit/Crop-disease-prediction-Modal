# 🌿 Crop Disease Prediction using CNN | Deep Learning in Agriculture

This project is a deep learning-based solution for **predicting diseases in crop leaves** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Trained on a dataset of **55,000+ images** of commonly cultivated plants, the model detects diseases with over **90% accuracy**, helping farmers and agri-tech systems take early preventive actions.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- 🔍 **Architecture**: 5-layer Convolutional Neural Network
- 🧾 **Dataset**: ~55,000 labeled leaf images from various crop species
- 39 Classes
  61486 Train images
  17676 Test images
- ⏱️ **Training**: 10 epochs
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: >90% on validation set

## 🏷️ Classes Covered

Includes a variety of crops and their most common diseases. Examples:
- Tomato (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight)
- Corn (e.g., Leaf Spot, Common Rust)
- Potato, Grape, Apple, etc.

> The dataset was preprocessed with resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better generalization.
